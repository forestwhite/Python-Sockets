# Python-Sockets
Python socket programming demonstrations

These are some Python socket programs I used for demonstration purposes in Fall 2016. They predominantly use UDP/TCP connections and properties.

Some programs do not work without administrator privileges (as shown in output and screenshots) because system-level settings are needed, such as RAW sockets.
